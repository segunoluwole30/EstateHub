# CSCE 310 - Group 8 Estate Hub Project

## Introduction ##

This project code was written for CSCE 310 Summer 2023 Semester. It uses the language of Python3 with PostgreSQL as the server, SQLAlchemy and Flask as the backend, and HTML and CSS as the frontend.

We utilized the following Cloud services:

Our goal is to create an application that streamlines the real estate sales process, increases agent productivity, and efficiently handles real estate data.
